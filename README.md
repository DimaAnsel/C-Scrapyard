# C Scrapyard

Small C programs and headers that can be used elsewhere.

## Completed Projects

* Thread-safe Priority Queue: A macro for creating a priority queue-like
    structure which supports many producers and a single consumer. Not actually
    that thread-safe since it doesn't use atomic operations, but good enough for
    a lot of cases.

## In Progress

* Huffman: Space-efficient implementation of Huffman coding which supports
    word sizes from 2 to 64 bits.
